# Core Rules for LLM Assistant

## Anti-Hallucination
- Only suggest proven technologies (3+ years production usage)
- Always verify before suggesting. If uncertain: research first. If still unverifiable: mark as "unknown". Never fabricate.
- Prefer established patterns, provide official documentation links

## Required Context (Always Do First)
1. **Load Core Documentation** ‚Üí Load these files IF NOT already in context:
   - **docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md** ‚Üí Tech stack, architecture, business context
2. **Load Step-Specific Docs** ‚Üí Each step defines additional required docs (load only if not in context)
3. **Scan Codebase** ‚Üí Use `ls`/`glob`/`grep` (or `Read`/`Grep` tools) to find existing patterns

## Decision Making
- Default "Yes" for clear requests
- Only ask clarifications for: ambiguous approaches, contradictory requirements, safety-critical decisions

## Request Type Detection
- **DETECT REQUEST TYPE**: Analyze user request and classify into one of three types
- **NOTIFY REQUEST TYPE**: Always inform user: "üìù Request type: [Knowledge] or [Coding-Workflow] or [Coding-Ask]"
- **KNOWLEDGE INDICATORS**: Questions about concepts, "what is", "how does", "explain", "difference between", general programming questions - NO codebase access
- **CODING-WORKFLOW INDICATORS**: Keywords like "implement", "add", "create", "fix", "refactor", "planning", "tasks", "review", "enhance", feature names, code changes - requires step-based workflow
- **CODING-ASK INDICATORS**: Questions about existing code, "analyze", "understand", "what does this do", "how does this work", debugging help - allows codebase access without workflow
- **IF UNCLEAR**: List options and ask user to choose:
  "ü§î Request type unclear. Please choose:
  1. **Knowledge** - General programming concepts, no codebase access
  2. **Coding-Workflow** - Structured development (implement, add, create, fix, refactor)
  3. **Coding-Ask** - Questions about existing code (analyze, understand, debug)
  
  Please reply with number (1/2/3) or type name."

## Step Execution Control
- **FOR CODING-WORKFLOW REQUESTS**: 
  1. **MANDATORY STEP DETECTION**: MUST determine appropriate step name from request context
     - Planning keywords ‚Üí `step-planning`
     - Task/breakdown keywords ‚Üí `step-tasks` 
     - Context/analysis keywords ‚Üí `step-1-context`
     - Skeleton keywords ‚Üí `step-2-skeleton`
     - Review keywords ‚Üí `step-3-review`
     - Enhancement/optimization keywords ‚Üí `step-4-enhance`
     - Implementation/business logic keywords ‚Üí `step-5-implement`
     - Project overview/documentation keywords ‚Üí `step-project-overview`
     - Method/function implementation keywords ‚Üí `step-method-implement` (standalone method, implement method, fill method, complete method, method body, function implementation)
     - Add body to method, write method logic, code method, build method functionality

**Note**: Distinguish between:
- **`step-5-implement`**: Full business logic implementation requiring planning/tasks context
- **`step-method-implement`**: Standalone method implementation without planning dependencies
  2. **NOTIFY USER**: Always inform user of detected step: "üîç Detected: [step-name] phase"
  3. **MANDATORY PROMPT CHECK**: MUST verify if the detected step's guide prompt exists in current context
  4. **IF FOUND**: Notify "‚úÖ Step prompt loaded" and use the step prompt to proceed
  5. **IF NOT FOUND**: üõëüõëüõë **ABSOLUTE STOP** - MUST ask user to load guide prompt: 
     "‚ùå [step-name] guide prompt NOT FOUND in context.
     üö´ CANNOT PROCEED without guide prompt.
     ‚ö° REQUIRED ACTION: Please run the guide command for [step-name] first.
     üîÑ Then ask your question again."
  6. **ABSOLUTELY NEVER PROCEED** without step prompt in context for coding-workflow requests - NO EXCEPTIONS
  7. **IF CANNOT DETECT STEP**: Ask user to specify: "Cannot determine step phase. Please specify which step: planning, tasks, context, skeleton, review, or enhance?"
     - Include method-implement for standalone method implementation requests
     ‚Üí Updated options: "Please specify which step: planning, tasks, context, skeleton, review, enhance, or method-implement?"

- **FOR CODING-ASK REQUESTS**: 
  1. **READ docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md**: Extract tech stack, architecture, constraints  
  2. **SCAN CODEBASE**: Use tools to find existing patterns and understand structure
  3. **ANALYZE & ANSWER**: Provide detailed analysis with code references and explanations
  4. **NO WORKFLOW REQUIRED**: Answer directly without step prompts or planning files

- **FOR KNOWLEDGE REQUESTS**: Answer as normal LLM without step detection or codebase context requirements

## Code Standards
- **File Size**: 500-line limit ‚Üí auto-refactor
- **Naming**: Follow codebase patterns first, then language conventions
- **Documentation**: Google docstrings, WHY not WHAT comments
- **Testing**: Use approach from docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md
- **Implementation**: Follow existing patterns (error handling, logging, DI, configs)

## Edit/Change Requirements
- **Clear explanations** - Brief explanation of what and why changes were made
- **Atomic changes** - One logical change per file edit
- **Follow patterns** - Use existing codebase patterns and conventions

## Quality Standards

### Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Naming conventions match existing codebase patterns
- [ ] Architecture patterns align with docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md and docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md
- [ ] All method signatures include proper type hints
- [ ] Comprehensive docstrings present (Google style)
- [ ] Interface definitions clear and complete
- [ ] Import statements follow project conventions
- [ ] No implementation logic in skeleton phase

### Post-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Error handling matches project patterns
- [ ] Logging follows established format and levels
- [ ] Dependencies properly injected following existing patterns
- [ ] Code consistency with existing implementations
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance implications considered
- [ ] Resource cleanup (connections, file handles, etc.)

### Security Standards
- Never commit secrets - check for accidental exposure
- Follow authentication patterns from project
- Validate all inputs using project validation patterns
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Follow HTTPS and security headers for web applications

### Testing Requirements
- Tests in `/tests` folder mirroring app structure
- **Coverage per feature**: happy path + edge case + failure test
- Update affected tests when modifying existing logic
- Follow testing framework specified in docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md

## Auto-Update Requirements
- docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md (new tech/architecture)
- docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md (new patterns/conventions)
- docs/CODEBASE-REFERENCE.md (new classes/functions)
- README.md (setup/usage changes)
- API docs (public interfaces)
