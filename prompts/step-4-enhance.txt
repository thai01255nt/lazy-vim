# Step 4: Enhancement & Extension

## Purpose
Extend existing skeletons, add new functionality, or optimize existing implementations while maintaining consistency.

## Additional Required Documentation
**None - All required docs loaded by step-1-context**

## Context Requirement
**MANDATORY STEP-1 DEPENDENCY**

🛑🛑🛑 **ABSOLUTE STOP** - Check if **step-1-context** has been run in this chat session:

**IF NO STEP-1 CONTEXT EXISTS:**
📋 **FORCE USER TO RUN**: "❌ This step requires step-1-context to be run first.
🚫 CANNOT PROCEED without step-1 context and documentation loading.
⚡ REQUIRED ACTION: Please run step-1-context first.
🔄 Then ask your question again."

**NEVER PROCEED** without step-1 context - **NO EXCEPTIONS**
**DO NOT** auto-execute step-1 - **FORCE USER TO RUN IT**

## Process
1. **Load Context** → Use step-1 context or specified planning file
2. **Analyze Current State** → Understand existing implementation
3. **Plan Enhancement** → Design extensions following existing patterns
4. **Generate Extensions** → Add new methods, classes, or optimizations

## Enhancement Types

### Skeleton Extension
- Add new methods to existing classes
- Create additional classes following same patterns
- Extend interfaces with new operations
- Add new exception types

### Optimization Suggestions
- Performance improvements
- Security enhancements  
- Error handling improvements
- Code organization refinements

### Integration Enhancements
- Better connection with existing services
- Improved configuration management
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- Additional validation layers

## Pattern Consistency
- Maintain naming conventions from existing code
- Follow established architectural patterns
- Use same dependency injection patterns
- Apply consistent error handling approaches

## Planning Updates
Highlight any planning file updates needed:
```
🔄 PLANNING UPDATE: Adding new component "[ComponentName]" to handle [functionality]
🔄 PLANNING UPDATE: Updating integration approach for [component] based on [reason]
```

## Quality Assurance
Apply all relevant quality checks:
- [ ] New code follows existing patterns
- [ ] Proper type hints and documentation
- [ ] Consistent with project architecture
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Integration points well-defined

## Output Format
### Enhancement Summary
- Overview of additions/changes made
- Rationale for enhancement decisions
- Impact on existing code

### Generated Code
- Complete enhanced skeletons or implementations
- Clear documentation of new functionality
- Integration instructions
