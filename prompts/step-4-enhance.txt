# Step 4: Enhancement & Extension

## Context Check
**MANUAL WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT**

Before proceeding, check if **feature planning context** exists in this chat session. If NO feature planning context available:

ðŸ›‘ **STOP - Do NOT auto-execute step-1**
ðŸ“‹ **REQUEST**: Please manually run `step-1-context` first to gather feature planning context
ðŸ”„ **THEN**: Return to run `step-4-enhance`

**LLM must ask user to run step-1 manually - DO NOT auto-execute.**

## Purpose
Extend existing skeletons, add new functionality, or optimize existing implementations while maintaining consistency.

## Process
1. **Load Context** â†’ Use step-1 context or specified planning file
2. **Analyze Current State** â†’ Understand existing implementation
3. **Plan Enhancement** â†’ Design extensions following existing patterns
4. **Generate Extensions** â†’ Add new methods, classes, or optimizations

## Enhancement Types

### Skeleton Extension
- Add new methods to existing classes
- Create additional classes following same patterns
- Extend interfaces with new operations
- Add new exception types

### Optimization Suggestions
- Performance improvements
- Security enhancements  
- Error handling improvements
- Code organization refinements

### Integration Enhancements
- Better connection with existing services
- Improved configuration management
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- Additional validation layers

## Pattern Consistency
- Maintain naming conventions from existing code
- Follow established architectural patterns
- Use same dependency injection patterns
- Apply consistent error handling approaches

## Planning Updates
Highlight any planning file updates needed:
```
ðŸ”„ PLANNING UPDATE: Adding new component "[ComponentName]" to handle [functionality]
ðŸ”„ PLANNING UPDATE: Updating integration approach for [component] based on [reason]
```

## Quality Assurance
Apply all relevant quality checks:
- [ ] New code follows existing patterns
- [ ] Proper type hints and documentation
- [ ] Consistent with project architecture
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Integration points well-defined

## Output Format
### Enhancement Summary
- Overview of additions/changes made
- Rationale for enhancement decisions
- Impact on existing code

### Generated Code
- Complete enhanced skeletons or implementations
- Clear documentation of new functionality
- Integration instructions

### Next Steps
- Implementation guidance for new components
- Testing recommendations for enhancements
- Deployment considerations
