# Step 2: Skeleton Generation

## Context Check
**MANDATORY STEP-1 DEPENDENCY**

🛑🛑🛑 **ABSOLUTE STOP** - Check if **step-1-context** has been run in this chat session:

**IF NO STEP-1 CONTEXT EXISTS:**
📋 **FORCE USER TO RUN**: "❌ This step requires step-1-context to be run first.
🚫 CANNOT PROCEED without step-1 context and documentation loading.
⚡ REQUIRED ACTION: Please run step-1-context first.
🔄 Then ask your question again."

**NEVER PROCEED** without step-1 context - **NO EXCEPTIONS**
**DO NOT** auto-execute step-1 - **FORCE USER TO RUN IT**

## Purpose
Generate complete structural framework with no implementation logic, based on planning file and codebase patterns.

## Additional Required Documentation
**None - All required docs loaded by step-1-context**

## Process
1. **Load Context** → Use step-1 context or specified planning file
2. **Design Structure** → Create classes, methods, interfaces based on planning
3. **Apply Patterns** → Follow existing codebase naming and architectural patterns
4. **Generate Skeletons** → Complete structure with proper typing and documentation

## Output Requirements
### Class Structures
- Complete class and method declarations
- Proper type hints for all parameters and returns
- Comprehensive Google-style docstrings
- Constructor with dependency injection following project patterns

### Interface Definitions
- Clear interface contracts
- Exception class definitions
- Type definitions and enums
- Import statements following project conventions

### Implementation Placeholders
- Empty method bodies with appropriate placeholders (`pass`, `throw new Error()`, etc.)
- **NO business logic implementation**
- Proper syntax for target programming language
- Comments indicating implementation areas

## Quality Checks (Auto-Applied)
- [ ] Naming conventions match existing codebase patterns
- [ ] Architecture patterns align with core docs, loaded docs, and planning
- [ ] All method signatures include proper type hints
- [ ] Comprehensive docstrings present
- [ ] Interface definitions clear and complete
- [ ] Import statements follow project conventions
- [ ] No implementation logic included

## Output Format
Present complete skeleton code with:
- Clear separation of components
- Explanation of architectural decisions
- Notes on integration points
