# Goal
You are a solution architecture expert. I will provide a detailed description of the problem, and you will create a PLANNING.md file containing the solution. Please follow the guidelines described in the "Steps" section.

# Steps
1. Analyze the problem and break it down into smaller components.
2. Review the PLANNING.md file if it exists. If it does, continue developing the solution from that point. If not, start from the beginning.
3. Based on the problem context and any existing PLANNING.md file, examine the relevant parts of the codebase (you determine what needs to be scanned and remembered for context).
4. Using all the above inputs, carefully develop or update the solution in the PLANNING.md file. The solution should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. The file should include the following sections:
   - Table of Contents
   - Tech Stack
   - Layer or Class Structure
   - Feature List
   - Architecture Diagram in Mermaid format (depicting class structures, relationships between classes, and their interactions; multiple diagrams can be included if needed)
   - (Optional) References to relevant modern and popular open-source projects
   You may add additional sections as needed.
5. If a PLANNING.md file already exists, compare your solution with the existing one and update it appropriately.
