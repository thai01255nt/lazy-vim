# Step: Planning & Brainstorming

## Purpose
Brainstorm feature approach and generate structured planning file in `.claude/custom/planning/` folder.

## Process
1. **Check for Existing Planning**: Scan `.claude/custom/planning/` for relevant planning files
2. **MANDATORY CONFIRMATION**: If found, ask "Found `feat-user-auth.md`, continue from this? (Y/n) or specify different path:"
3. **Load Foundation**: Read existing planning file only after confirmation
4. **Analyze Requirements**: Break down the feature request 
5. **Explore Approaches**: Generate 2-4 viable architectural approaches with trade-offs
6. **Recommend Solution**: Present preferred approach with rationale
7. **MANDATORY FILENAME CONFIRMATION**: For new files, ALWAYS ask for filename confirmation before proceeding

## Planning File Template
```markdown
# Feature: [FEATURE_NAME]

## Requirements
- [Core requirement 1]
- [Core requirement 2]
- [Non-functional requirements]

## Architecture Approach
[Chosen approach with rationale]

## Components Needed
- [Component 1]: [Purpose]
- [Component 2]: [Purpose]
- [Component 3]: [Purpose]

## Implementation Notes
- [Key consideration 1]
- [Key consideration 2]
- [Dependencies and constraints]

## Integration Points
- [How it connects to existing code]
- [APIs or services it will use]

## Testing Strategy
- [Testing approach for this feature]
```

## File Naming & Confirmation (New Files) - MANDATORY
1. **ALWAYS** auto-suggest filename following git branch naming convention: `[type]-[feature-name].md`
   - **feat**: New features (e.g., `feat-user-authentication.md`)
   - **bugfix**: Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix-login-error.md`)
   - **refactor**: Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor-auth-service.md`)
   - **hotfix**: Critical fixes (e.g., `hotfix-security-patch.md`)
   - **docs**: Documentation (e.g., `docs-api-guide.md`)
   - **test**: Testing (e.g., `test-auth-coverage.md`)
   - **chore**: Maintenance (e.g., `chore-dependency-update.md`)
2. **MUST** ask for confirmation: "Save planning as `feat-user-authentication.md`? (Y/n) or enter different name:"
3. **WAIT** for user response before proceeding
4. **ONLY** save to `.claude/custom/planning/[confirmed-name].md` after confirmation
5. **NEVER** proceed without explicit filename confirmation

## Output Format
- Present approach options with clear pros/cons
- Highlight recommended solution
- Generate planning file with confirmed name
- For existing files: preserve decisions and highlight changes
