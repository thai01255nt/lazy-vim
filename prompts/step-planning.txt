# Step: Planning & Brainstorming

## Purpose
Auto-list what needs to be solved, discuss solutions, save confirmed decisions. For simple features, just describe context for task generation.

## MANDATORY Process
1. Extract feature context from user request
2. Check existing files in `.claude/custom/planning/`
3. If found, ask "Found `existing-file.md`, continue from this? (Y/n):"
4. **Ask brainstorm mode**: "This feature needs brainstorming? (Y/n):"
5. **If brainstorming**: Auto-generate problem list, wait for user review, go through items ONE BY ONE, discuss solutions
6. **If no brainstorming**: Just describe feature context for task generation
7. Save using template format with filename confirmation

## Template Format
**For brainstorming mode:**
```markdown
# [FEATURE_NAME]

## [Problem 1]
[Solution after discussion]

## [Problem 2]  
[Solution after discussion]
```

**For simple context mode:**
```markdown
# [FEATURE_NAME]

## Context
[Brief description of what needs to be implemented for task generation]
```

## File Naming Rules
1. **ALWAYS** auto-suggest: `[type]-[feature-name].md` (feat, bugfix, refactor, etc.)
2. **MUST** ask confirmation: "Save planning as `filename.md`? (Y/n) or enter different name:"
3. **NEVER** proceed without explicit filename confirmation
4. **ONLY** save to `.claude/custom/planning/[confirmed-name].md` after confirmation
