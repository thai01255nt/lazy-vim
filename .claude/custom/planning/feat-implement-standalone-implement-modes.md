# Implement + Standalone Implement Modes Redesign

## Problem 1: Mode Purpose & Context Distinction
**Solution:** Clear separation between context-dependent implement mode and independent standalone implement mode:

**Implement Mode (Context-Dependent):**
- Purpose: Convert skeleton TODOs + tasks into working business logic
- Context Required: Planning file (architecture decisions) + Tasks file (business requirements) + Skeleton code (TODO structure) + All 4 docs
- Workflow: Part of planning → tasks → skeleton → implement flow
- Focus: Comprehensive implementation with complete project context

**Standalone Implement Mode (Independent):**
- Purpose: Quick method implementation without full workflow context
- Context Required: Auto-scan codebase + CODEBASE-MAP.md + PATTERNS-CONVENTIONS.md (if available)
- Workflow: Independent of planning/tasks, direct implementation
- Focus: Fast, pattern-based method completion and fixes

**Key Differences:**
- Context dependency: Full workflow vs minimal auto-detected
- Speed: Comprehensive vs fast immediate implementation
- Scope: Multiple methods/features vs single focused methods
- Integration: Part of workflow vs independent operation

## Problem 2: Method Detection & Confirmation Flow
**Solution:** Smart method detection with streamlined confirmation process:

**Multi-Level Search Strategy:**
- Level 1: Exact match → methodName() in specific class
- Level 2: Fuzzy match → similar names (createUser vs createNewUser)
- Level 3: Context search → methods from tasks/planning context
- Level 4: Pattern match → methods with similar functionality
- Level 5: Create new → offer creation if not found

**Enhanced Confirmation Flow:**
- Single method: Show context, dependencies, implement confirmation
- Multiple methods: List with context, choose individual or batch
- Fuzzy matches: Suggest corrections with similarity ranking
- Not found: Smart creation suggestions with location recommendations

**Reuse Method Creation Strategy:**
- Always identify reusable sub-functionality when implementing
- Create reuse methods even if skeleton exists
- Add TODO comments for all reuse method calls
- Auto-generate method stubs with comprehensive TODO documentation

## Problem 3: Existing Code Reuse Strategy
**Solution:** Multi-layer intelligent reuse detection system:

**Layer 1 - Direct Method Reuse:**
- Search CODEBASE-MAP.md for exact functionality matches
- Find similar parameter patterns and existing services
- Identify utility functions and helper methods

**Layer 2 - Pattern Reuse:**
- Analyze error handling, logging, validation patterns
- Apply response formatting and architectural patterns
- Maintain consistency with existing code structures

**Layer 3 - Architectural Reuse:**
- Follow dependency injection patterns
- Apply database interaction and API patterns
- Maintain security and performance patterns

**Smart Integration Features:**
- Automatic import detection and resolution
- Code style matching with existing patterns
- Priority-based reuse (exact → similar → pattern → architectural)

## Problem 4: Missing Dependencies Handling
**Solution:** Enhanced TODO comment system with categorization and priority:

**Contextual TODO Format:**
```typescript
/**
 * TODO: [CATEGORY] Implement methodName()
 * Purpose: [Brief description of functionality]
 * Context: [From tasks/planning - business requirement]
 * Priority: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] - [reasoning]
 * Dependencies: [Other methods this depends on]
 * Returns: [Expected return type and meaning]
 */
```

**Dependency Categories:**
- [UTILITY] - Input validation, data transformation helpers
- [SERVICE] - Business logic services and domain operations
- [REPOSITORY] - Data persistence and database operations
- [INTEGRATION] - External service calls and third-party integrations

**Auto-Generated Stub Methods:**
- Create method signatures for missing dependencies
- Include comprehensive TODO documentation
- Generate implementation roadmaps with priority ordering
- Link to planning/tasks context and documentation references

## Problem 5: Implementation Quality Standards
**Solution:** Comprehensive multi-tier quality framework:

**Tier 1 - Code Structure:**
- Clear method organization (validation → business logic → persistence)
- Single responsibility and separation of concerns
- Consistent naming and readable control flow

**Tier 2 - Error Handling:**
- Comprehensive try-catch with specific error types
- Structured error logging with context
- Proper error transformation and user-friendly messages

**Performance & Security Standards:**
- Efficient database operations and async/await usage
- Input sanitization and comprehensive validation
- Rate limiting, audit logging, secure password handling
- Performance monitoring and resource cleanup

**Testing & Documentation:**
- Comprehensive JSDoc with examples and error documentation
- Test-driven structure with dependency injection
- Performance monitoring hooks and metrics collection

## Problem 6: Integration with Other Modes
**Solution:** Seamless integration with automatic updates and cross-mode communication:

**Context Handoff Protocols:**
- Implement mode: Planning → Tasks → Skeleton → 4 Docs → Implementation
- Standalone: Auto-scan → CODEBASE-MAP → PATTERNS-CONVENTIONS → Quick implementation

**Automatic Status Updates:**
- Tasks file: Auto-update completion status, dependencies, quality scores
- Planning file: Update component progress, performance metrics, blockers
- Real-time notifications between modes

**Workflow Integration:**
- Sequential flow: skeleton → implement → review mode suggestions
- Parallel implementation support with conflict detection
- Smart workflow suggestions based on completion status

**Progress Tracking:**
- Auto-generated implementation dashboard
- Cross-mode data synchronization
- Integration quality metrics and consistency validation
- Context preservation across mode switches
