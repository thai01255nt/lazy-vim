# Step 1: Context Analysis

## Purpose
Gather all necessary context for development by reading project overview, planning file, and scanning codebase patterns.

## Process
1. **Use PROJECT-OVERVIEW Context** → Apply tech stack, architecture patterns, constraints from PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md
2. **Extract Feature Context** → Analyze user's feature request to determine feature type and name
3. **Auto-Suggest Planning File** → Generate filename following git branch naming: `[type]-[feature-name].md`
4. **Scan for Planning File** → Check `.claude/custom/planning/` for the suggested file
5. **MANDATORY CONFIRMATION** → Force stop and ask confirmation if planning file found
6. **Auto-Find Tasks File** → Check `.claude/custom/tasks/` for corresponding tasks file
7. **Analyze Integration Points** → Understand how new code will connect to existing system using PROJECT-OVERVIEW context

## Planning File Detection & Confirmation
1. **Extract feature context** from user request
2. **Auto-suggest planning filename** following git branch naming: `[type]-[feature-name].md`
3. **Scan `.claude/custom/planning/`** for the suggested file
4. **If found**: 🛑 **STOP** - Ask confirmation "Found `feat-user-auth.md`, use this planning file? (Y/n)"
5. **WAIT** for user response before proceeding
6. **If confirmed**: Load planning file and continue
7. **If not found**: 🛑 **STOP** - Ask user to create planning file first: "Planning file not found. Please run planning step first for this feature."

## Tasks File Detection
- Check `.claude/custom/tasks/` for file with same name as planning file
- **If found**: Auto-load tasks file: "Found corresponding tasks file `user-authentication.md`"
- **If missing**: Stop and request manual step execution: "⚠️ No tasks file found. Please run step-tasks first to generate tasks breakdown, then rerun step-1-context."

## Context Analysis Output
### Project Context
- Tech stack and frameworks in use
- Architecture patterns (layered, microservices, etc.)
- Code organization and naming conventions
- Testing approach and patterns

### Planning Context  
- Feature requirements and scope
- Chosen architecture approach
- Components to be implemented
- Integration points and dependencies

### Tasks Context (if available)
- Current task breakdown and priorities
- Completed vs remaining work
- Task dependencies and milestones
- Implementation progress status

### Codebase Patterns
- Similar existing implementations
- Naming conventions used
- Error handling patterns
- Logging and monitoring patterns
- Configuration patterns

## Session Context Storage
Store context for use by subsequent steps in this chat session:
- Project tech stack and patterns
- Planning file path and contents
- Tasks file path and contents (if available)
- Identified codebase patterns
- Integration requirements
