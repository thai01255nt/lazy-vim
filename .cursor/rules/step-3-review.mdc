# Step 3: Implementation Review

## Purpose
Review implementation against established patterns, planning decisions, and quality standards.

## Context Requirement
**REQUIRES STEP-1 CONTEXT** - If no feature planning context exists in this chat:

ðŸ›‘ **STOP** - Do NOT proceed
ðŸ“‹ **REQUEST**: Ask user to manually run `step-1-context` first
ðŸ”„ **THEN**: Return to run `step-3-review`

## Process
1. **Load Context** â†’ Use step-1 context or specified planning file
2. **Analyze Implementation** â†’ Compare user's implementation against skeleton and patterns
3. **Validate Patterns** â†’ Ensure consistency with existing codebase
4. **Suggest Improvements** â†’ Recommend optimizations and corrections

## Review Areas

### Pattern Consistency
- Compare against existing similar implementations
- Verify naming conventions match codebase patterns
- Check architectural pattern adherence
- Validate integration with existing services

### Code Quality
- Error handling follows project patterns
- Logging uses established format and levels
- Dependencies properly injected
- Resource cleanup implemented
- Security considerations addressed

### Planning Alignment
- Implementation matches planning decisions
- All planned components included
- Integration points properly implemented
- Requirements satisfied

## Quality Validation (Auto-Applied)
- [ ] Error handling matches project patterns
- [ ] Logging follows established format and levels
- [ ] Dependencies properly injected following existing patterns
- [ ] Code consistency with existing implementations
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance implications considered
- [ ] Resource cleanup (connections, file handles, etc.)

## Planning Updates
Highlight any planning updates needed:
```
ðŸ”„ PLANNING UPDATE: [Description of what needs to be added/changed in planning file]
```

## Output Format
### Review Summary
- Overall assessment of implementation quality
- Adherence to planning and patterns
- Key strengths and areas for improvement

### Specific Recommendations
- Concrete suggestions for improvements
- Code examples for corrections
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Security enhancements
